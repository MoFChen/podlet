# Podlet

Podlet will generate [podman](https://podman.io/) [quadlet](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-systemd.unit.5.html) (systemd-like) files from a podman command.

## Status

Podlet is currently a work-in-progress. This is my (@k9withabone) first real rust project and is mostly meant as a learning project for myself. That said, contributions, suggestions, and/or comments are appreciated!
